HW: Update Boston Software Jobs to add company names and descriptions

Using the files you created for the previous homework, add the ability for the user to display multiple companies on the Companies page. For each company, your app should collect a company name, logo, and a blurb about what the company does. Attached is a text file with blurbs and logo URLs for several companies.

For this assignment you will need a loop, and you will probably loop through an array. However, from there you have choices: you may decide to use multiple arrays (images, company names, and blurbs, for example), or you may want to use an array of objects, where each object represents a single company. This aspect of the program design is up to you.

Note: The mockup for this assignment uses a Bootstrap class called thumbnail (but this is optional). If you add the class thumbnail to the div holding each company's logo and text, it will create a little gray border with slightly rounded corners. It's also a good idea to give your div a width (say 20% or so).

When finished, commit to a new repository, push to GitHub and submit the new URL below.

BONUS: Instead of creating a new repository, create this update as a branch on your existing project repository. Push to GitHub and submit the URL below. Don't forget to tell us the branch name! smile
