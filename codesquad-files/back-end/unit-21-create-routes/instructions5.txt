HW: Create Routes for Boston Software Jobs

Use the mental framework of "CRUD" to make routes to the following sections:

* Home page
* Read all companies (write this route first, but it should appear after Create when you're done)
* Create new company details page
* Update a company
* Delete a company

Don't forget to add forms to the correct pages in order to create a new company and to update a company.
